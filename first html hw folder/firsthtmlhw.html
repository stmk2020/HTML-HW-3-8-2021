		<h1> What is this? </h1>
			<p>
				This is not a Mazda MX-5, BMW M5, Ford GT, or any automobile at all (shocker I know) but in fact my first ever website.  
				I'm also not Doug Demuro or Jeremy Clarkson, I am but a HS student and I study Computer Science as an elective (best 
				class hands down though).  For my team's term project we decided to build Chess in HTML and JS. However to build 
				my HTML and JS skills this is just me playing around.  Later I might have to practice working with A* and how to 
				limit it based on the pieces used but that is for another time.  Have fun! (or don't in which case why not leave?) and
				remember, everything is not what it seems.
